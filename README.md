## Who am I ?
I am currently doing a Master Of Engineering at CentraleSupélec, a top French Engineering school, part of the Paris Saclay University (#1 in Maths worldwide - Shangai ranking). With my broad engineering background and my strong scientific mind, I am namely interested in the domains of machine learning, blockchain and software engineering. Always looking forward to acquiring knowledge and skills through meaningful experiences, I am eager to unravel complex problematics.
